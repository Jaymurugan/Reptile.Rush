## Python Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Pygame library in Python.

## Game Description
The Snake Game is an arcade game where the player controls a snake. The snake moves around the screen, and the player's goal is to eat food items that appear randomly. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Prerequisites
To run the game, you need to have the following:

* Python 3.x
* Pygame library

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Install the Pygame library by running the following command:
pip install pygame

## How to Play
1. Run the snake_game.py file.
2. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys: up, down, left, and right.
3. The snake will move continuously in the direction specified by the arrow keys.
4. Your objective is to eat the food items that randomly appear on the screen to make the snake grow longer.
5. Be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body, as it will result in game over.
6. The game will display your current score, which corresponds to the length of the snake.
7. Press 'Q' to quit the game or 'C' to play again after game over.
Have fun playing the Snake Game!
